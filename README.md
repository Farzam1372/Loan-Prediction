# Loan-Prediction

# My Adventure ðŸš— 
Trying my first online data science challenge was exciting! I learned a lot about real data and making models. It wasn't just a contest â€“ it helped me learn a ton about data science.

I love learning new things, and I can't wait to do more challenges! ðŸš€ I want to solve more data problems and get better at it.

# Challenge OverviewðŸŽ¯ 
Financial institutions globally leverage loan services across various industries. One pivotal objective is to mitigate payment defaults and ensure consistent loan repayments. This is often achieved by employing machine learning models to predict potential defaulters, enabling efficient resource allocation and targeted interventions.

In this challenge, we dealt with the loan default prediction problem on a unique and intriguing dataset from individuals who availed financial loans in 2021. The goal was to build a model that could predict the likelihood of an individual defaulting on their loan payments, thus aiding the financial institution in effectively allocating resources and support to these borrowers
