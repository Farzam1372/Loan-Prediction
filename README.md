# Loan-Prediction
ðŸš— My Adventure
Trying my first online data science challenge was exciting! I learned a lot about real data and making models. It wasn't just a contest â€“ it helped me learn a ton about data science.

I love learning new things, and I can't wait to do more challenges! ðŸš€ I want to solve more data problems and get better at it.

ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Summary
Banks want to predict who might not pay back their loans. They use machine learning to do this. In this challenge, we worked on a dataset from people who got loans in 2021. We tried to build a model to guess who might not pay back their loans. This helps banks use their money better.
